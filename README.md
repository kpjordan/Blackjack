# Blackjack

Hello! 

This is the first thing I've ever really written, not just in Ruby but in any language with the exception of a few "hello world" type experiments. It took a few months and I learned quite a lot in the process.

It's a text-based blackjack game.  Run "play.rb" to play! That's all there is to it.

Enjoy!
